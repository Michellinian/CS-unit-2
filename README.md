**How does binary number work?**

| A | B | C | D |             
| ---| --- | --- | --- |     
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |

| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |

| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

This is the table of the binary numbers from 0 to 16. From this table we observe how each digit have their own distinct pattern. In D, 0 and 1 change one by one. In other words, the pattern "01" is repeated through the whole table as you go down. In C, the pattern becomes "0011", and in B it is "00001111", and finally in A it is "0000000011111111". What is happening here is that,
