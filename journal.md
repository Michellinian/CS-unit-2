Unit 2 Journal
-------

### Class 1 (2019/11/04)

For our first class on unit 2, before we directly moved on to unit 2, we did a reflection of the overall of unit 1. We linked the unit 1 project, with the ib syllabus and see the how it's connected. Then we moved on to the next unit. This unit is about creating a program for people who cannot use a keyboard or a mouse. We need to create a program, which can function with 2 buttons. In this way the users will have less difficulty using the program. What we are going to program is a program that converts english into morse code, and morse into binomial and vice versa. We also started using a new tool called arduino, and a new app called tinkercad. I hope to have more description of how we can use it, and delve into the apps  more from the next class.
