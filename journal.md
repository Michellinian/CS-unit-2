Unit 2 Journal
-------

### Class 1 (2019/11/04)

For our first class on unit 2, before we directly moved on to unit 2, we did a reflection of the overall of unit 1. We linked the unit 1 project, with the ib syllabus and see the how it's connected. Then we moved on to the next unit. This unit is about creating a program for people who cannot use a keyboard or a mouse. We need to create a program, which can function with 2 buttons. In this way the users will have less difficulty using the program. What we are going to program is a program that converts english into morse code, and morse into binary and vice versa. We also started using a new tool called arduino, and a new app called tinkercad. I hope to have more description of how we can use it, and delve into the apps  more from the next class. 


### Class 2 (2019/11/11)

Our second class of unit 2, was about creating the traffic light program using the arduino. We used the arduino kit to physically create a circuit, of traffic light. we also used an online app called the tinkercad, and tested the program virtually. In arduino, the language that is used is modern c, and modern c has a lot of similarity with bash in a way, but also differences. Speaking of comparing the two programming languages, we did an ib test practice about evaluating the 2 languages, and listing all the pros and cons of the program. I learned in this lesson, how to use the arduino, as well as how to create a correct circuit that functions without any problem. We learned about how the same row are essentially the "same", meaning when connecting to a hole in that row, and connecting another one in a different hole but in the same row, is essentially the same thing. I hope to learn new things in the upcoming lessons. 


### Class 3 (2019/11/13)

For this class, We started learning about binary numbers. We started by researching how decimals are converted to binary. After researching, we started to create another led circuit using the idea of binary numbers. We could only use 0 or 1, to light 2 different leds in various ways. First, it took me some while to understand how binary works, and then after getting the whole concept, I was able to understand how to create the code. This was my first time to learn about binary numbers, and it was very confuding for me, I don't think I still understand it fully, but at least I got a vague idea of how binary numbers function. Sometimes, I know I don't understand something but I don't know what to ask. This is that time. I know that I don't understand binary to the fullest extent, although I don't know what questions to ask. I think practicing more would help me understand.

### Class 4 (2019/11/18)

After being given our weekend task of creating a led circuit with buttons, with buttons being the input, and leds being the output, we did a brief review. Then we learned a new way of coding things, which was using something called the binary gates. By using this, it allows us to make the code very compact. We don't have to use if statements anymore if we use this. This was one of the most hardest thing to understand. I did understand howe it works, but I don't think I understood why. Again I don't understand what I don't understand, so I think the more practice, the better. I need to go over the binary gates over again to familiarize myslef with them. The symobols are very difficult to remember which is which, I also need to rememeber that.

### Class 5 (2019/11/20)

In today's class we first used binary gates to actually code the weekend task. After Dr.Pinzon showed us the code, we worked more on binary gates. We practiced how to write an symbols eqaution using binary gates. We learned how to convert the symbols of bianry gates into actual equation symbols, meaning "+", "-", and etc. We also learned about creating tables and based on the table finding the equation using binary gates. We also learned about the bases of binary. I still don't understand what a base is. I though binary was only 0 and 1m but does, for examlpe base 10, count as binary? Except for this, I think I understood this pretty well, since I managed to do most of the questions in the worksheet. After school, I need to try altering my code using binary gates, to see if I really understood how to use them.

### Class 6 (2019/11/21)

We used our previous knowledge about arduino, binary, and binary gated, to create a digital number output system. We tried to recreate the numbers sometimes diplayed on alarm clocks, where there are 7 lines organized in an 8 shape, and by changing the place where led turns on, it can be any nunmber from 0 to 9. We tried creating that using arduino. We first made a table, to show the behaviors of all the leds though 1 to 7, and then we create the equation for each leds. After trying it inside the tinkercad app, we physically created the circuit, and we used a cardboard to represent the digital number display. We penetrated 7 leds, in an 8 shape. We did not finish creating this circuit so we hope to finish in the next lesson.
For this class, we started creating another circuit. 

### Class 7: Absent 

### Class 8 (2019/11/25)

Todays task: "Enter English text then show in the serial monitor, and then use the led screen". We started programming the main code for unit 2. Our ultimate task is to create a conversion system from english to binary and vice versa. And in order to do that, our first step was to come up with an idea of how we want the input system to be.  For example, the input that we came up with was creating a display with all the possible letteres and characters, and one button will move the cursor to the right, while the other button was to select the letter. There are various ways to approach this, but we can only use 2 buttons for our input, so it needed to be as efficient as possible. Then after coming up with an idea we started coding. 

### Class 9 (2019/11/27)

This class was also dedicated to creating the incomplete code from last class. But before we did that, first we practiced some possible IB questions. The first question was about some inputs, that make the user easier to access, and the second question was about converting binary into hexadecimal. Both questions, at first I did not understand anything, but after listening to the explanation, I completely understood how to answer the questions. And then after doing this, we went back to developing our code, although at the end of the class, we came up with a "class" idea, about how the input could be. Our final idea was, displaying all the characters, and making the users select by puching the button, although we decided to put the most used letters in front and the least at the very end, so that we can give the users an easier chance the type in the words. Then we worked out the first bit of the code together, and then started developing the rest of the code on our own. 

### Class 10 (2019/12/02)

First thing in class we asked questions about how the input system is going to work. We has questions such as "how to display the characters on the LCD screen", "Switch between the english and binary / morse", and so on. After going through these questions, we learned a little bit about the computer architecture. In a computer there is a CPU, and different types of memories, which was difficult to understand for me. I need to learn more about this during the winter break. Then we moved on to the real task of developing the input system. We were given the English input code from the teacher and after seperating into our own groups, we had to create the cicuit, as well as the flow diagram of the input system code. We made 2 different circuits, just in case one of them didn't work so we had a backup. Also the English input code was somewhat understandable but still hard, so I couldn't finish the flow chart during class time. 

### Class 11 (2019/12/04)

Today was the test day. We had a paper test and a practical test where we had to create a certain program. The practical test was very hard, and I couldn't manage to make it function well so I added comments to at least show how I want the program to look like. 

### Class 12 (2019/12/10)

Last class was cancelled due to the human rights day. During this class we continued developing our Enlgish input system. After finishing this step, we moved on to translating the message into either morse or binary. I worked on the translation between english and morse. We were intoruduced to a new command "switch case" statement. It works very similarly to if statements. By using this we decided to assign every letter with the corresponding morse code. When the user sends the message, it detects what characters are in the message, as well as how many characters are in the message, and then it performs the switch case command. Despite of if it actually works or not, I think our process was quite successful, We still haven't tried our code. Also we started thinking about how the user can recieve the morse code. We thought about using one or two light bulbs. When one, we used the usual morse code, meaning time based, on and off of the light bulbs to receive the message. Our second option was to use two light bulbs, and when dot we only use one light, and when dash we use two light bulbs and so on. We had a little discussion about that, although we didn't come up with a solid idea during this class. 

### Class 13 (2019/12/11)

For our final class in the semester, we developed the translation program. We decided to list all the pros and cons of each idea we had for translating english to morse. Then finally we decided to develop the program using the time based one. Because the code itself wouldn't be that much of the difference, we decided to go with that first, and maybe change it afterwards. It would not be that hard to change the program. We didin't finish developing the code because of the time, although we know where we are going with this, which I think is a very good ending of the second semester. 

### Class 14 (2020/01/06)

In the first class of 2020, we started off with learning about the normal C language iinstead of the arduino C. We created two programs, both counting program. The oucome had to be something like this: 
1                 1
2 2               2 3
3 3 3             4 5 6
4 4 4 4           7 8 9 10
5 5 5 5 5         11 12 13 14 15 
For the first one we went through together, and then we did the second program individually using the first code as reference. Then after that we started learning about protocols. Since we need to transmit the messages to other stations, we need to use a certain protocol. We started off with learning what protocols are, and the different types and their usages. 

### Class 15 (2020/01/08)

Today's class was mainly about coding. We got a lot of exercises of coding with standard c. It was about checking the syntax, as well as checking our basic programming skill. We had the whole lesson to code the 10 exercises. It was a very good practice, and I managed to program every exercise without any help, except for one tiny help relating to queation 2.

### Class 16 (2020/01/13)

We had 2 main parts in today's class. The first section was learning about the machine cycle. We watched a video about the main components of the computer, and how data transfers work within a computer. We did some examples, and eventually we created our own machine cycle that performs a certain performance. This was hard to understand, although after practicing, I got a beter understanding of how it works. Then we continued with the development of unit2. We tried testing our code, although we didn't have enough time to test it. Although the code seems to be pretty good, apart from its actual functionality which we don't know yet. Today's class was somewhat straightforward, there are no questions that I want to ask right now, although I know I would have a lot, if I understand the amchine cycle deeper.

### Class 17 (2020/01/15)

This period was also dedicated to developing the unit 2 program. We started testing the code for the english to morse translation. We had several tries, although it kept giving us error, so we had to remodify the code over and over. The testing still wasn't successful, although we did make some progress, and now we may have an idea of how to fix the code. We first need to organize the codes, with correct parenthethes and indentations. I think then we can clear the errors. 

### Class 18 (2020/01/20)

We started off with the kahoot to check what we've learnt so far in unit 2. It was actually hard although I managed to get some of the questions correct. I also used common sense to answer some questions, which led me to right answer. Although, I still felt the need to not only practice coding, but also review more about how the computers works. Then we did a small coding practice using arrays. The first section, I was able to do it alone, although,　for the second section about generating random numbers, I had help for classmates and teachers to figure out the code. After that we went back to developing the translation program. We are now done with the english to morse program, and moving on to the english to morse translation. We thought this would have to be done all in the same arduino, although after discovering that we could use 2 arduinos, things got a lot easier. We are very close to finishing the code, except for one question: How do you print something on lcd? If we can answer this question, we would be able to fully develop the communication program.
