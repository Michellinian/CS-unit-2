Unit 2 Journal

### Class 1 (2019/11/04)

For our first class on unit 2, before we directly moved on to unit 2, we did a reflection of the overall of unit 1. We linked the unit 1 project, with the ib syllabus and see the how it's connected. Then we moved on to the next unit. This unit is about creating a program for people who cannot use a keyboard or a mouse. We need to create a program, which can function with 2 buttons. In this way the users will have less difficulty using the program. What we are going to program is a program that converts english into morse code, and morse into binomial and vice versa. We also started using a new tool called arduino, and a new app called tinkercad. I hope to have more description of how we can use it, and delve into the apps  more from the next class. 


### Class 2 (2019/11/11)

Our second class of unit 2, was about creating the traffic light program using the arduino. We used the arduino kit to physically create a circuit, of traffic light. we also used an online app called the tinkercad, and tested the program virtually. In arduino, the language that is used is modern c, and modern c has a lot of similarity with bash in a way, but also differences. Speaking of comparing the two programming languages, we did an ib test practice about evaluating the 2 languages, and listing all the pros and cons of the program. I learned in this lesson, how to use the arduino, as well as how to create a correct circuit that functions without any problem. We learned about how the same row are essentially the "same", meaning when connecting to a hole in that row, and connecting another one in a different hole but in the same row, is essentially the same thing. I hope to learn new things in the upcoming lessons.
